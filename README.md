# Radiator-Performance-Calculation
    Performance calculations of a heat exchanger (rating problem) (here - automotive radiator) are carried out 
    when the heat exchanger is available, but it is usually used Effectiveness - Number of Transfer Unit (NTU) 
    Method to determine the amount of heat transferred, outlet temperatures, and pressure losses of both fluids 
    (coolant and air). In these radiator performance calculations, many equations and variables must be used in 
    repeated iterations. Hand calculation can be both time-consuming and prone to mistakes, so, MATLAB code has 
    been written and uploaded to GitHub.
